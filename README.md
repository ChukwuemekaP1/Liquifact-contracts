# LiquiFact Escrow Contract

Soroban smart contracts for LiquiFact, the invoice liquidity network on Stellar. This repository currently contains the `escrow` contract that holds investor funds for tokenized invoices until settlement.

### Per-instance funding asset and registry (issues #113, #116)

- Rust 1.70+ (stable)
- Soroban CLI (optional for deployment)

For local development and CI, Rust is enough.

### Treasury dust sweep (issue #107)

```bash
cargo build
cargo test
```

## Storage-only upgrade policy (additive fields)

**Compatible without redeploy** when you only:

- Add **new** `DataKey` variants and/or new `#[contracttype]` structs stored under **new** keys.
- Read new keys with `.get(...).unwrap_or(default)` so missing keys behave as “unset” on old deployments.

**Requires new deployment or explicit migration** when you:

- Change layout or meaning of an existing stored type (e.g. new required field on `InvoiceEscrow` without a migration that rewrites `DataKey::Escrow`).
- Rename or change the XDR shape of an existing `DataKey` variant used in production.

**Compatibility test plan (short):**

1. Deploy version _N_; exercise `init`, `fund`, `settle`.
2. Deploy version _N+1_ with only new optional keys; repeat flows; assert old instances still readable.
3. If `InvoiceEscrow` changes, add a migration test or document mandatory redeploy.

`migrate` today validates `from_version` against stored `DataKey::Version` and errors if no path is implemented.

### `DataKey` naming convention

## Escrow contract

- `init`: Create an invoice escrow.
- `get_escrow`: Read the current escrow state.
- `fund`: Record funding, track each investor's principal contribution, and mark the escrow funded once the target is reached.
- `settle`: Mark a funded escrow as settled.
- `get_investor_count`: Return the number of distinct investors recorded for the escrow.
- `get_investor_contribution`: Return the principal amount recorded for one investor.
- `max_investors`: Return the supported investor cap for one escrow.

## Storage guardrails

The escrow stores a per-investor contribution map inside the contract instance. That map is intentionally bounded.

- Supported investor cardinality: `128` distinct investors per escrow
- Product assumption: invoices that need more than `128` backers should be split across multiple escrows or a higher-level allocation flow
- Security goal: prevent denial-of-storage attacks that keep inserting new investor keys until a single contract-data entry becomes too large or too expensive to update

The regression tests in `escrow/src/test.rs` enforce these assumptions:

- The `129th` distinct investor is rejected.
- Re-funding an existing investor at the cap is still allowed.
- At `128` investors, the serialized investor map and escrow entry must stay below documented byte thresholds.
- The final insertion at the cap must stay within a bounded write footprint.

These limits are designed to keep the contract well below Soroban's contract-data entry limits and to catch future schema changes that would bloat per-investor storage.

## Security notes

- Funding amounts must be positive.
- Distinct investor growth is capped per escrow.
- Funding totals and investor balances use checked addition to avoid overflow.
- Storage-growth tests act as regression guards against accidental state bloat.

## CI

Run these before opening a PR:

```bash
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo build
cargo test
